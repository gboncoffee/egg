EGG stands for "Emulador Genérico do Gabriel" ("Gabriel's Generic Emulator", in
portuguese). It's a modular emulator for processor architetures, made for
educational purpouses.

The `egg` package itself provides only an interface for interacting with
machines, thus supporting different architeture backends. Currently, there are
RISC-V IM 32 bits, MIPS32 and a fantasy 8 bit architecture "Sagui" backends
implemented.

`egg/assembler` also provides a small library for creating assemblers, and the
support for EGG's debugger.

at the campus and the laboratories!

## Installation

Simply grab the static binary for your OS at the
[releases](https://github.com/gboncoffee/egg/releases) page. Or, if you have the
Go compiler, build the project from source.

Note: I always test the binary for Linux x86_64. I test Darwin (x86_64 and
ARM64) if I manage to. Other binaries are not tested but should work properly.

## Quickstart

EGG is a command line application, you must run it from a terminal emulator.

Running the emulator with an Assembly file will assemble it and start a machine
to run it on. By default, the machine is a RISC-V IM 32 bits. Use the flag `-a`
or `-arch` to change the architeture. Run `egg -h` to see all command line
options and `egg -l` to see all supported architetures.

The Assembly syntax is architeture-dependent. Though, a library is provided for
creating assembler, so backends may use the same overall syntax (both RISC-V and
MIPS uses it).

An example follows:

```asm
; Semicolon makes a comment til the end of line.

; A label is defined with :.
label:
	; Instruction arguments starts with destination.
	addi t0, zero, 2

	; You may also put instructions after the labels.
label2:	add t0, t0, t0

	; There's no parenthesis as in RARS, store uses common immediates.
	sb t0, ra, 3

	; Hex, octal and binary immediates are supported.
	addi t1, zero, 0xff
	addi t1, zero, 0b010110
	addi t1, zero, 0o644
	addi t1, zero, 0755	; A leading 0 also defines an octal.

; A # defines a literal til the end of the line.
; Literals are inserted unchanged to the binary (as 'db' in other assemblers).
; If a % is followed by two hex digits, the hex value is inserted instead. Use
; %% to escape it.
msg:
#Hello, World!%0a

; Some directives are supported. "bitsxx" ones creates literal numbers in the
; code, with the bit length specified:
.bits8 0xca 0xfe 0xba 0xbe 0xde 0xad 0xbe 0xef
.bits16 0xcafe 0xbabe 0xdead 0xbeef
.bits32 0xcafebabe 0xdeadbeef
.bits64 0xcafebabedeadbeef
; The "space" directive adds some bytes of spacing in the code:
.space 16
; The "include" directive "copy-pastes" another file in the code:
.include other-asm.asm
```

Each architeture folder has test Assembly files you may use as examples.

## Calls

Standard calls handled by the emulator are as follows. Refer to the architeture
documentation on how to perform them:

- BREAK (Number 1): Transfer control to debugger or stop the machine.  
  No arguments.  
- READ (Number 2): Read input.  
  - Argument 1: Buffer address.  
  - Argument 2: Size of input in bytes.  
- WRITE (Number 3): Write output.  
  - Argument 1: Buffer address.  
  - Argument 2: Size of output in bytes.  

## Debugger

The debugger interface is kinda similar to `gdb`, though much smaller. Use the
`-d` flag to enter debugger uppon startup. There's no need of `run` command, as
there's no process. The `next` or the `continue` commands may be used to start
running the program normally. Use `help` to see all available commands.

## Supporting the project

EGG is actively used for computer science education and maintained by myself and
other volunteers. You can support our work by joining us writing code, helping
with the docs and checking for bugs.
